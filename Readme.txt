Most Appropriate Facility-
->We are providing the input consisting of Zipcode and CustomerID. 
We have created a separate database with two tables table in Oracle SQL for Customer locations and customer details.(We have taken all copart locations from Copart website).
We fetch the customer zipid related to that customerId and then find the most appropriate location.
 This is done by first storing all the zip codes and their addresses in HashMap with zip code as Key and then finding the closest zip (by min difference) and populate hashmap value (which is address).
->Run the program.
